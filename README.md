# Robust server structure: Major error types and handling assessment

## Instructions
Your task is to extend the given API server, which stores "Notes," to enhance the error-handling functionality. It has the following existing route handlers:
- GET /notes returns an array of notes
- POST /notes creates a new note
- GET /notes/:noteId returns a single note by ID

## Existing files
You should only need to edit code inside src/app.js.
Use the existing data files located in src/data for the responses. Feel free to add or remove data from the files as necessary, but keep the same shape of the data.

## Tasks
1. Modify the existing error handler so that it does the following:
- Returns a 500 status code by default, or the status code stored in the status property of the error object.
- Returns a JSON response formatted like { error: "<error-message-here>" }.
2. Move the validation logic in the GET /notes/:noteId route handler into its own middleware function. In the event of an error, your validation middleware should call next() with an error object (i.e., { status: ..., message: ...}) as the argument so that it can be passed along to the error handler.
3. Move the validation logic in the POST /notes route handler into its own middleware function. In the event of an error, your validation middleware should call next() with an error object (i.e., { status: ..., message: ...}) as the argument so that it can be passed along to the error handler.
Hint: if the text property is missing from the body of the POST, return the following error message: "A 'text' property is required."
